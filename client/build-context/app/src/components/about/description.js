const description = `I am a 4th year software engineering student at Concordia University.
Engineering internships with CAE, Microsoft, and Genetec have afforded me the opportunity to develop a number of web, mobile, and desktop applications.
I take a "jack of all trades, master of some" approach to software development and
do my best to have working knowledge of modern development frameworks, tools, and programming languages.
I like to wear many hats, and as a result, often find myself performing the role of both Software and DevOps engineer in a team.
I am most proficient with C# and the .NET platform. As an aspiring engineer,
I strongly believe that success is almost entirely dependent on drive and persistence.`;
